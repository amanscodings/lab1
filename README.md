To appraoch this code what i decided to do was to use the example given in class for the approach. I knew for both both 2 numbers had to add to target. 
I made sure to use loop. Then i decided to create a target and with the current number where it would check the difference. Then i created a return the difference 
displaying 2 numbers. I thought of this approach because what this code does it checks the target, and the current number and it just has to calculate it correctly.
